# System Overview

## Introduction

The **Open Research Engine (ORE)** is a deterministic, LLM-free scientific reasoning engine designed to automate the synthesis of research papers. Unlike modern stochastic approaches that rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for generation, ORE employs a deterministic pipeline combining classical Information Retrieval (IR), Graph Theory, and Statistical Analysis to ensure reproducibility, traceability, and hallucination-free output.

## Philosophy & Goals

### 1. Determinism
Every step of the ORE pipeline, from ingestion to report generation, is deterministic. Given the same input data and configuration, the system produces the exact same output. This is achieved by:
-   Fixing random seeds in clustering algorithms (e.g., KMeans).
-   Using deterministic hashing for deduplication (SHA-256).
-   Avoiding stochastic generative models.

### 2. LLM-Free Architecture
ORE avoids the "black box" nature of LLMs. Instead, it relies on explicit, explainable algorithms:
-   **TF-IDF & BM25** for lexical importance.
-   **Vector Embeddings (BERT)** strictly for semantic similarity search, not generation.
-   **Co-occurrence Matrices** for logical inference (e.g., identifying research gaps).

### 3. Traceability
Every claim or insight generated by the system can be traced back to a specific chunk of text in a specific source paper. The system maintains a strict chain of custody from raw PDF to final insight.

## Technology Stack

The system is built on a robust Python stack designed for performance and reliability:

-   **Backend Framework:** FastAPI (handling API requests)
-   **Interface:** Gradio (interactive web UI)
-   **Database:** SQLite (metadata storage) with SQLAlchemy ORM
-   **Vector Search:** FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
-   **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn (Clustering, TF-IDF), SentenceTransformers (Embeddings)
-   **Text Processing:** Regex (Tokenization), rank_bm25 (Sparse Retrieval)

## Core Capabilities

1.  **Deep Ingestion:** Parsing and normalizing academic papers from PDFs.
2.  **Hybrid Retrieval:** Combining sparse (keyword) and dense (semantic) search for high-recall info retrieval.
3.  **Gap Analysis:** statistically identifying missing intersections between methods and datasets.
4.  **Cluster-based Synthesis:** Grouping content by semantic topics to generate coherent reports.
