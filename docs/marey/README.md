# MAREY

## Technological Apex Development Plan

> "If your system can run, MAREY can run better."

MAREY (formerly Optimus Ultra) is an adaptive media processing system designed to run on any hardware, from legacy laptops to supercomputer clusters.

## Core Philosophy: Absolute Adaptability

*   **Zero Compromise:** Runs on anything.
*   **Maximum Adaptation:** Self-optimizing in real-time.
*   **Universal Execution:** CPU, GPU, DSP, NPU - if it computes, we use it.

## Architecture

The system is built as a **Modular Monolith** with distributed-ready interfaces.

### Core Modules
*   **Hardware Intelligence Layer (Phase 0):** Deep system profiling.
*   **Model Capability Abstraction (Phase 1):** Matching models to hardware.
*   **Video Processing (Phase 2):** Adaptive frame pipelines (Coming Soon).
*   **Orchestration (Phase 4):** Distributed workload management (Coming Soon).

## Setup

1.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2.  Run hardware detection: `python -m marey.cli detect`
3.  Manage models: `python -m marey.cli_models list`
